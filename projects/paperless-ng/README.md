# Paperless-ng Notes

## Setup local environment
just run [install-paperless-ng.sh](projects/paperless-ng/install-paperless-ng.sh) in the [projects/paperless-ng](projects/paperless-ng/) directory and answer the questions for setup. It will create a `paperless-ng` subfolder (unless you change it), a `docker-compose.yml` file, and start the docker instance.

It will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000/dashboard](http://localhost:8000/dashboard)

I got the [install-paperless-ng.sh](projects/paperless-ng/install-paperless-ng.sh) script from [here](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/blob/master/install-paperless-ng.sh)
